<p> Organised and led an ad hoc group of slaves into a series of consecutive military victories against the vast, professional and better resourced Roman army. By doing so, Spartacus brazenly and powerfully struck at the very epicentre of the largest empire of the ancient world almost bringing it to its knees. During a chaotic two year period of the uprising, fundamental questions around basic human rights issues such as equality, justice and freedom circulated in a way that had never previously been possible, offering hope to many oppressed people. The Roman empire was forced into being extremely careful in its management of slaves and its conquered lands following these experiences.

      <h2>Legacy</h2>
      <p>
      The efforts and achievements of Spartacus has been used as a symbol and inspiration for oppressed people throughout history as a motivating force to shake up an unjust system. For instance, the revolutionary spirit was invoked by leaders of the successful Haitian independence movement against French colonisers during the 1790â€™s. As such, Spartacus is regarded as a hero for the downtrodden because he is thought to embody a deep-seated sense of struggle against tyranny and subjugation. This he did by demonstrating unflinching persistence and the utility of guerrilla tactics against a better equipped force. Unsuprisingly, the sheer compelling nature of this historical narrative has ensured Spartacus has become a major figure within popular culture. Books, poems and musical performances have all celebrated the achievements and courage of the slave revolt. Additionally, Stanley Kubrick's 1960 Hollywood epic introduced the figure to a wider audience as have two recent television series. The bravery, solidarity and heroism exuded by the slaves has resulted in many sports teams around the world adopting the name of Spartacus to denote the values of their club and commitment to their cause. </p>
